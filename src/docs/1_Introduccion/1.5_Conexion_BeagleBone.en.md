## 1.5 Connection to the BeagleBone Black

To interact with and debug the bare-metal operating system on the BeagleBone Black, it’s essential to establish a proper serial connection and correctly power the board. This section explains the complete process to achieve stable communication with the board from a host computer.

### Connection Requirements

1. **Mini USB Cable (Power):**

   * Connects the BeagleBone Black's mini-USB port to the PC.
   * This cable supplies 5V power to the board and can also enable a USB console (though in this project FTDI is used).

2. **FTDI USB-to-Serial Adapter (TTL 3.3V):**

   * For UART communication.
   * Connected to the **J1** port on the board.
   * Ensure you're using a 3.3V FTDI to avoid damaging the board.

### Serial Pin Connection (J1)

| PIN NUMBER | SIGNAL   | FTDI             |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| 1          | Ground   | GND              |
| 4          | Receive  | Adapter TX       |
| 5          | Transmit | Adapter RX       |

> **Warning:** Never connect TX to TX or RX to RX. FTDI TX must go to BeagleBone RX, and vice versa.

### Terminal Program Configuration

**[CoolTerm](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/coolterm.html)** is recommended to view the system’s UART output. This software offers a simple and effective serial communication setup.

#### Communication Parameters:

* **Baud Rate:** `115200`  
* **Data Bits:** `8`  
* **Parity:** `None`  
* **Stop Bits:** `1`  
* **Flow Control:** `None`

> In CoolTerm, select the COM port corresponding to the FTDI. Then configure the parameters above and open the connection.

Once the board is connected and powered:

* You should see **U-Boot** loader messages in the terminal if everything is working.
* After that, OS messages will appear (e.g., "Starting OS...").

### Disabling Autoboot

When booting with an SD card:
```
setenv bootdelay -1
saveenv
```

When there is no SD card before doing the loadys add:
`
setenv -1
`

### Board Power Supply

* **Mandatory Requirement:** The BeagleBone Black is not powered solely by the FTDI. You must also connect the mini-USB cable or an external power supply (5V 2A barrel jack).
* **Verification:** When you connect the power cable, the status LEDs (USR0-USR3) should light up. If they don't, check the connections or the power supply.
