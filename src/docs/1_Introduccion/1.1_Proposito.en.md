## 1.2 Purpose of the Operating System

This operating system implements a bare-metal multiprogramming environment on the BeagleBone Black with an ARM Cortex-A8 processor, without a memory management unit (MMU).

* **Manage multiple processes in memory**, ensuring alternating execution through a Round-Robin scheduler activated by timed interrupts.
* **Separate the execution context of each process**, using control structures (PCBs) and independent stacks to ensure integrity during context switches.
* **Initialize and directly control essential hardware**, including UART for serial communication, DMTimer2 for periodic intervals, and the INTC for interrupt handling.
* **Demonstrate cooperative multitasking concepts**, where processes do not voluntarily yield control, but are interrupted by the operating system at regular intervals.
* **Promote a modular architecture**, allowing a clear separation between operating system code and user processes.
