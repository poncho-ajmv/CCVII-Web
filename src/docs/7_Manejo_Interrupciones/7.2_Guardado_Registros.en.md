## Register Saving

### Design Principle

In a system without hardware support for multitasking, the ability to save and restore the processor context defines the possibility of running concurrent processes. **Register Saving** **each process must resume at the exact same point where it was interrupted, with the same registers**.

### Preserved Registers

During an interrupt, the system saves the following registers:

* r0 to r12: general registers for free use.
* lr: link register, contains the return address.
* spsr: on more advanced systems, to preserve the previous mode (optional in this context).

In this project, registers are saved on the stack of the active process using assembler:

```asm
irq_handler:
    push {r0-r12, lr}
    mov r0, sp
    bl timer_irq_handler
    mov sp, r0
    pop {r0-r12, lr}
    subs pc, lr, #4
```

### Why It's Done in Assembler

* Prevents the compiler from optimizing or hiding critical operations.
* Ensures full control over the order and manner of memory access.
* Allows independence from any C ABI or calling convention.

### Scheduling Integration

The stack pointer (sp) with the saved context is passed to select_next_process(sp), which saves it in the PCB:

```c
current_process->stack_pointer = sp;
```

The newly selected process has its stack already prepared. Upon returning to assembler, that stack is restored as sp, and the registers are reloaded with:

```asm
pop {r0-r12, lr}
subs pc, lr, #4
```

### Transparency Guarantee

This design ensures that:

* The current process can resume without knowing it was interrupted.

* No volatile log information is lost.
* Any process can be interrupted and resumed at any point, deterministically.
