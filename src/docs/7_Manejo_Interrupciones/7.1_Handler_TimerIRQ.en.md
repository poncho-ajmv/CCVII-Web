## Timer IRQ Handler

### Handler Purpose

The timer interrupt handler (DMTimer2's IRQ) is the operating system's entry point each time a time interval expires. From the perspective of the full control paradigm, the IRQ is the "external signal" that forces the operating system to regain control of the CPU, allowing the scheduling algorithm to be applied.

This mechanism allows the system to implement **controlled preemption**: without this handler, the system would not be able to force process switches or control CPU usage deterministically.

### Complete Execution Flow

1. The DMTimer2 timer overflows and generates an interrupt (IRQ 68).
2. The INTC handler redirects to the defined vector for interrupts.
3. irq_handler in startup.s saves the context and transfers control to C:

```asm
irq_handler:
    push {r0-r12, lr}         // Preservar contexto
    mov r0, sp                // Pasar stack pointer actual
    bl timer_irq_handler      // Delegar la l√≥gica al C handler
    mov sp, r0                // Restaurar nuevo stack pointer
    pop {r0-r12, lr}          // Restaurar registros
    subs pc, lr, #4           // Salto de retorno IRQ
```

4. timer_irq_handler(void* sp) executes the scheduling logic:

* Pauses the timer (TCLR = 0).
* Clears the interrupt flag (TISR = 0x2).
* Calls select_next_process(sp) to select the next process.
* Restarts the timer (TCLR = 0x3).
* Returns the new stack pointer to the assembler to continue execution.

```c
void* timer_irq_handler(void* sp) {
PUT32(TCLR, 0x0);
PUT32(TISR, 0x2);
PUT32(INTC_CONTROL, 0x1);
void* new_sp = select_next_process(sp);
PUT32(TCLR, 0x3);
return new_sp;
}
```

### Total Control Paradigm

This design makes the transition between processes explicit.

* Defines what is saved.
* Decides when it is interrupted.
* Controls how it is resumed.

Nothing happens automatically. This transparency reinforces error tracing and step-by-step system validation.

### Observed Effect

Thanks to this handler, user processes alternate in an interleaved manner, generating serial output such as:

```
0
1
2
a
b
c
3
4
...
```

This indicates that the system is correctly executing the timer-induced round-robin scheduling.
