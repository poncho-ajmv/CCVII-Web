## Timer Management

### Timer Role

The timer is the main mechanism for enforcing context switches and supporting the Round-Robin algorithm. The system uses the **DMTimer2** peripheral of the AM335x processor, configured to generate periodic overflow interrupts.

### Timer Initialization

The timer is configured in the `timer_init()` function within `timer.c`. The steps are as follows:

1. **Enable the timer clock:**

   ```c
   PUT32(CM_PER_TIMER2_CLKCTRL, 0x2);
   ```

2. **Unmask IRQ 68 in the INTC controller:**

   ```c
   PUT32(INTC_MIR_CLEAR2, 1 << (68 - 64));
   ```

3. **Stop the timer before configuring it:**

   ```c
   PUT32(TCLR, 0);
   ```

4. **Set the load value to start counting from a specific point**

   ```c
   PUT32(TLDR, 0xFE91CA00); // ~3 segundos según el reloj del sistema
   PUT32(TCRR, 0xFE91CA00);
   ```

5. **Enable overflow interrupts:**

   ```c
   PUT32(TIER, 0x2);
   ```

6. **Start the timer in auto-reload mode:**

   ```c
   PUT32(TCLR, 0x3);
   ```

### Timer Interrupts

When an interrupt occurs:

* The interrupt controller invokes irq_handler, which saves the context in assembly.
* Then timer_irq_handler(void* sp) is called to:

  * Temporarily stop the timer.
  * Clear the interrupt flag (TISR).
  * Perform a context switch via select_next_process.
  * Reactivate the timer.

```c
void* timer_irq_handler(void* sp) {
    PUT32(TCLR, 0x0);
    PUT32(TISR, 0x2);
    PUT32(INTC_CONTROL, 0x1);

    void* new_sp = select_next_process(sp);
    PUT32(TCLR, 0x3);
    return new_sp;
}
```

### Mechanism Outcome

This mechanism ensures that the system remains active by rotating between user processes without manual intervention. It also allows all processes to share CPU time at regular intervals.

### Considerations

* The values of TLDR and TCRR can be adjusted to vary the execution time slice per process.
* The timer should be slow enough to observe output, yet fast enough to demonstrate concurrency.

### Timer role in the sistem
The timer is a central component for the temporal scheduling of processes. Its main function is to interrupt the execution of the current process after a fixed time interval and allow the scheduler to select another process to run. This mechanism implements a form of **forced cooperative multiprogramming**, since processes do not voluntarily yield the CPU but are instead interrupted at regular intervals.

The system uses the **DMTimer2** from the AM335x SoC of the BeagleBone Black. This peripheral allows:


* Counting cycles based on the system clock.
* Triggering interrupts upon overflow.
* Operating in auto-reload mode to generate periodic interrupts without manual reset.

### Timer Initialization Flow

The timer configuration process is carried out in the timer_init() function and consists of the following sequential steps:

1. **Peripheral clock activation:**
   Enables DMTimer2 operation by setting its enable bit in the CM_PER_TIMER2_CLKCTRL register.

   ```c
   PUT32(CM_PER_TIMER2_CLKCTRL, 0x2);
   ```

2. **Interrupt enablement:**
   Unmasks IRQ 68 corresponding to DMTimer2 in the INTC_MIR_CLEAR2 register and sets its priority.

   ```c
   PUT32(INTC_MIR_CLEAR2, 1 << (68 - 64));
   PUT32(INTC_ILR_0 + 0x110, 0x0);
   ```

3. **Timer halt during configuration:**
   Ensures the timer is off before writing to its registers.

   ```c
   PUT32(TCLR, 0);
   ```

4. **Load value definition (count start):**
   Configures the counter to start from a value close to 0xFFFFFFFF to trigger an overflow after a specific number of cycles.

   ```c
   PUT32(TLDR, 0xFE91CA00);
   PUT32(TCRR, 0xFE91CA00);
   ```

5. **Overflow interrupt activation:**
   Ensures an interrupt is triggered at the end of the count.

   ```c
   PUT32(TIER, 0x2);
   ```

6. **Start timer in auto-reload mode:**
   The 0x3 configuration in TCLR enables counting and automatic reload.

   ```c
   PUT32(TCLR, 0x3);
   ```

### Interrupt Handling Mechanism

Every time DMTimer2 overflows, it generates an interrupt that is captured in the irq_handler vector (in startup.s). This handler performs the following:

1. **Saves Context (r0-r12, lr).**
2. **Calls timer_irq_handler(sp), passing the current stack pointer**
3. **Inside timer_irq_handler:**

   * Temporarily stops the timer to avoid new interrupts during context switching.
   * Clears the interrupt flag (TISR).
   * Calls select_next_process(sp) to obtain the new stack pointer.
   * Restarts the timer for the next cycle.

```c
void* timer_irq_handler(void* sp) {
    PUT32(TCLR, 0x0);               // Pausar temporizador
    PUT32(TISR, 0x2);               // Limpiar interrupción
    PUT32(INTC_CONTROL, 0x1);       // Finalizar interrupción en INTC

    void* new_sp = select_next_process(sp);  // Cambio de contexto

    PUT32(TCLR, 0x3);               // Reanudar temporizador
    return new_sp;
}
```

### Accuracy Considerations

* The TLDR value determines the CPU quantum duration. This value can be adjusted to change the scheduling frequency.
* A time that is too short may overload the system due to excessive interrupts. One that is too long may reduce system responsiveness.

### Robustness and Control

The timer is designed to be robust:

* Prevents nested interrupts using cpsid i when necessary.
* Can be monitored via PRINT of ticks or stack addresses.
* The design ensures that the timer never interferes with processes beyond context switching.

### Integration with the Scheduler

The timer and scheduler are tightly coupled:

* The timer provides the trigger for switching.
* The scheduler decides which process to run next.
* The stack pointer returned by timer_irq_handler() is restored in assembly via mov sp, r0 and bx lr to resume execution.

This approach ensures controlled and transparent rotation between active processes in the system.

Slow enough to observe the output, but fast enough to demonstrate concurrency.

This design leverages the AM335x hardware to simulate an effective cooperative scheduler in a bare-metal environment.
