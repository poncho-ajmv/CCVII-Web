## Round-Robin Algorithm

### General Description

The Round-Robin scheduling algorithm implemented in this system defines a deterministic and fair strategy to share CPU usage among multiple processes. It is based on the sequential and cyclic execution of ready processes, where each one gets a time slice (quantum) to run before yielding control to the next. This mechanism is managed by timer interrupts, with no need for manual intervention.

### Scheduler Behavior

The scheduler is designed to operate entirely from interrupts. During each timer interrupt:

1. The currently running process is suspended.
2. Its context (stack register, state) is saved.
3. It is reinserted into the waiting list if still in a valid state.
4. The next ready process to run is selected.
5. Its context is restored.
6. The timer is restarted and control passes to the new process.

This continuous cycle ensures an orderly rotation among all active processes.

### Technical Implementation

The function `select_next_process(void* sp)` in scheduler.c contains the core logic of the scheduler. Important aspects:

* **State preservation:**

  ```c
  current_process->stack_pointer = sp;
  current_process->state = READY;
  enqueue(current_process);
  ```
  Saves the stack_pointer of the process being replaced.

* **Next process selection:**

  ```c
  current_process = dequeue();
  current_process->state = RUNNING;
  ```

  Retrieves the next ready process from the waiting list.

* **Stack initialization if first run:**

  ```c
  if (current_process->stack_pointer == current_process->stack) {
      current_process->stack_pointer = initialize_stack(...);
  }
  ```

* **Return of new context:**

  ```c
  return current_process->stack_pointer;
  ```

### Fairness Considerations
Round-Robin ensures each process has the opportunity to run, with no privileges or priorities. This scheduling type:

* Prevents process starvation.
* Facilitates debugging by observing interleaved sequences.
* Aligns with a forced cooperation model rather than voluntary.

### Interaction with the Timer

Each context switch is triggered by DMTimer2, causing the scheduler to act at fixed moments, regardless of the internal state of the process. This independence guarantees:

* Equal CPU time.
* Centralized control from the OS.
* Elimination of dependence on process behavior.
