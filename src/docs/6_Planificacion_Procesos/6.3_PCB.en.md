## PCB Structure

### Purpose of the PCB

The Process Control Block (PCB) is the fundamental unit for process management in the operating system. Each PCB represents an individual process, encapsulating all the information required to create, execute, pause, and resume a process at any time. It is the key mechanism for performing safe and efficient context switches.

### Separation Paradigm

The use of PCBs enforces a separation of responsibilities: processes know nothing about the operating system or the scheduling mechanism. Likewise, the operating system does not need to know the internal implementation of the process; it only needs to know where to start (`process_function`) and where to continue (`stack_pointer`).

This abstraction promotes:

* Modularity.
* Error traceability.
* Process substitutability without altering the scheduler's architecture.

### Data Structure

The PCB structure is defined in pcb.h as:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned int pid;
    unsigned int priority;
    void* stack_pointer;
    unsigned int* stack;
    state_process state;
    void (*process_function)(void);
} PCB;
```

#### Field Descriptions

* pid: Unique numeric identifier for the process.
* priority: Reserved value for future improvements with priority-based scheduling.
* stack_pointer: Points to the last used value of the stack; essential for context restoration.
* stack: Points to the memory block assigned as the static stack for the process.
* state: Current state of the process (e.g., READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED).
* process_function: Pointer to the entry function that defines the process logic.



### Process States

The system defines the following states using an enum:

```c
typedef enum {
    CREATED,
    READY,
    RUNNING,
    BLOCKED,
    TERMINATED
} state_process;
```

These states allow the scheduler to decide whether a process is eligible for execution or should be skipped.

### Initialization and Creation
During system initialization (create_table() in pcb.c), all PCBs are marked as available:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_PROCESSES; i++) {
    process_table[i].pid = -1;
    process_table[i].state = TERMINATED;
}
```

Initialization and Creation
During system initialization (create_table() in pcb.c), all PCBs are marked as available:

When a new process is created using create_process():

* A PID is assigned.
* The stack is assigned from kernel_stacks.
* The initial state is set to CREATED
* The entry function is registered.

```c
pcb->stack = &kernel_stacks[num_processes][0];
pcb->stack_pointer = pcb->stack;
pcb->state = CREATED;
pcb->process_function = function;
```

### Usage During Context Switch

Durante an interrupt:

* The current stack pointer (sp) is stored in the stack_pointer of the active process's PCB:

```c
current_process->stack_pointer = sp;
```

* The scheduler then selects the next process, and its stack_pointer is used to restore the context.

```c
return current_process->stack_pointer;
```

### Relationship with the Scheduler and the Waiting List

Processes in the READY state are placed on the waiting list using enqueue(PCB*). When the scheduler needs a new process, it extracts it with dequeue() and transitions its state to RUNNING. This direct integration between PCB and scheduling structures ensures organized and controlled execution.
