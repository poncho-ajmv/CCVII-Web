## 2.2 Status Registers

The ARM Cortex-A8 includes a set of status registers that control processor behavior and record critical system information. These registers are essential for interrupt management, privilege access control, and operation mode handling.

### Types of Status Registers

There are two main categories of status registers:

* **CPSR (Current Program Status Register)**: contains the current processor state.
* **SPSRs (Saved Program Status Registers)**: used by exception modes to save the CPSR before handling an interrupt or exception.

In total, the processor defines a **global CPSR** and up to **six SPSRs** available in privileged modes (FIQ, IRQ, Supervisor, Abort, Undefined, and Monitor).

### CPSR Functions

The CPSR register contains several fields that determine processor behavior:

* **Condition Flags (N, Z, C, V)**: indicate the result of the most recent arithmetic or logic operation.
* **Interrupt Control Bits (I, F)**:
  * I (Interrupt Disable): when set, disables IRQ interrupts.
  * F (Fast Interrupt Disable): when set, disables FIQ interrupts.
* **Operation Mode (bits M\[4:0])**: defines the processor's current mode (User, Supervisor, etc.).
* **Processor State**: indicates whether it is in ARM, Thumb, or ThumbEE mode.

This register is accessed via specific instructions (MRS, MSR) and can be modified to enable/disable interrupts, switch modes, or inspect the result of recent operations.

### SPSR Functions

When an exception occurs, the processor automatically saves the CPSR to the **SPSR corresponding to the exception mode**. This allows the exception handler to operate without altering the previous system state, and once complete, restore the original CPSR to transparently resume execution of the interrupted code.

SPSRs are only available in privileged modes and are crucial for implementing interrupt handlers, as they allow preservation and restoration of the full execution context of the interrupted process.
