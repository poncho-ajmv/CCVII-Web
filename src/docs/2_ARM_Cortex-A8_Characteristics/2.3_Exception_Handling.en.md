## 2.3 Exception Handling

The ARM Cortex-A8 exception handling mechanism allows the processor to respond to internal or external events that require immediate attention, such as interrupts, memory access errors, or invalid instructions. When an exception occurs, the processor temporarily interrupts normal execution, preserves the current context, and transfers control to a specific handler routine.

### General Behavior

When an exception is detected, the processor:

1. **Preserves the current state** by saving the CPSR contents into the SPSR of the corresponding exception mode.
2. **Stores the return address** in the r14_mode register (also known as the Link Register, LR, of the active mode).
3. **Switches to the appropriate exception mode** (FIQ, IRQ, etc.).
4. **Branches to the exception handler address**, as defined in the vector table.
5. **Disables nested interrupts**, if necessary, using the I and F bits of the CPSR.

Once the handler completes, the processor can return to the original context by restoring the CPSR from the SPSR and reloading the Program Counter (PC) with the value saved in r14_mode.

### Types of Exceptions

The processor can handle various exceptions, each with its own vector and mode:

* **Reset**: triggered after a system reset.
* **Undefined Instruction**: occurs when an invalid or unsupported instruction is encountered.
* **Software Interrupt (SWI)**: invoked via a specific instruction, commonly used for system calls.
* **Prefetch Abort**: error during instruction fetch from an invalid address.
* **Data Abort**: error accessing data from memory.
* **IRQ (Interrupt Request)**: standard interrupt from peripherals (e.g., DMTimer2).
* **FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request)**: high-priority fast interrupt.

> ⚠️ If multiple exceptions occur simultaneously, the processor handles them in a fixed priority order, with **Reset** being the highest, and **FIQ** having higher priority than **IRQ**.

### IRQ Handling

The **IRQ** exception is triggered by a low level on the nIRQ line. During IRQ handling:

* The processor switches to **IRQ mode**.
* The return address is saved in r14_irq.
* The CPSR is stored in SPSR_irq.
* IRQs are automatically disabled (bit I = 1).
* The handler may return using:

```asm
SUBS PC, R14_irq, #4
```

This restores the CPSR from the SPSR and returns to the instruction following the interrupted one.

The IRQ bit in the SCR register can redirect the exception to IRQ mode or to Monitor mode when using TrustZone.

### Exception Vectors

The ARM Cortex-A8 uses an exception vector table to define entry addresses for each exception type. This table can be located at:

* **0x00000000** (low vectors)
* **0xFFFF0000**  (high vectors), enabled via CP15 c1 bit[13].

The **VBAR** (Vector Base Address Register) and **Monitor Vector Base Address Register** define the base addresses for vectors in non-secure and secure environments, respectively. High vectors do not affect the Monitor mode.
