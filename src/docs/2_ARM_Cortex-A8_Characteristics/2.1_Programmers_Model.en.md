## 2.1 Programmer’s Model

The ARM Cortex-A8 provides a flexible and powerful programming model, designed to support both general-purpose and real-time embedded systems. This model is based on a multi-register architecture, differentiated operation modes, and execution states that enable effective separation between user context, exception handling, and interrupt management.

### Execution States

The processor can operate in three distinct instruction execution states:

* **ARM State**: executes 32-bit ARM instruction set.
* **Thumb State**: executes 16-bit compact instructions optimized for memory savings.
* **ThumbEE State**: a variant of Thumb State targeted at Java environments and virtual machines.

These states determine the size and type of instructions that are interpreted and executed in the processor's pipeline.

### Operation Modes

The Cortex-A8 implements eight operation modes, each with specific purposes for managing execution flow and system control:

* **User (usr)**: normal execution mode for user processes.
* **System (usr)**: similar to User, but with extended privileges for the OS.
* **Supervisor (svc)**: privileged mode used at boot or for handling software exceptions.
* **IRQ (irq)**: mode used to handle regular interrupts.
* **FIQ (fiq)**: specialized mode for fast, high-priority interrupts.
* **Abort (abt)**: mode entered after memory access failures.
* **Undefined (und)**: mode entered when executing invalid instructions.
* **Monitor (mon)**: reserved mode for security operations (TrustZone).

Each mode may have access to a different subset of registers, facilitating context separation without the need to save/restore all global registers on every mode switch.

### Register Architecture

The processor defines a total of **33 general-purpose 32-bit registers** and **7 status registers**. Not all registers are accessible simultaneously; the visible set depends on the processor’s current mode and state.

Notable registers include:

* **r14 (Link Register)**: stores the return address after a call or interrupt.
* **r15 (Program Counter)**: points to the currently executing instruction.

#### Banked Registers

Some modes have *banked* registers, i.e., mode-specific versions of certain registers only visible within that mode. This allows, for example, each mode to have its own stack and return point.

| Mode           | Identifier |
| -------------- | -----------|
| User           | usr        |
| Fast Interrupt | fiq        |
| Interrupt      | irq        |
| Supervisor     | svc        |
| Abort          | abt        |
| System         | usr        |
| Undefined      | und        |
| Monitor        | mon        |

The **FIQ** mode has seven exclusive banked registers from r8 to r14, enabling fast interrupt handling with minimal overhead by avoiding shared register saving. Additionally, the **Monitor, Supervisor, Abort, IRQ**, and **Undefined** modes each have their own versions of r13 and r14, providing separate stacks and link registers for each mode.
