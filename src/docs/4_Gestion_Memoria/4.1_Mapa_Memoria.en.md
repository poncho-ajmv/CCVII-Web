## 2. Memory Management

### Static Memory Map

The operating system does not use an MMU, so all memory mapping must be **static** and predefined. This approach ensures that each component has a fixed location and does not conflict with other segments during execution.

The main memory is organized as follows:

| Component       | Start Address  | Size   |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| OS (kernel)     | 0x80000000     | 128 KB |
| OS Stack        | 0x80008000     | 32 KB  |
| Process 1 (p1)  | 0x80010000     | 128 KB |
| Stack of p1     | 0x80018000     | 32 KB  |
| Process 2 (p2)  | 0x80020000     | 64 KB  |
| Stack of p2     | 0x80028000     | 32 KB  |

This layout ensures **isolation between processes and the kernel**, and helps detect errors such as stack overflows.
