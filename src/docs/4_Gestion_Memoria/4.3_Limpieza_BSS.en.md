### Clearing the .bss Section

The `.bss` section **is not automatically cleared**, so it is our responsibility to ensure that all uninitialized variables are set to zero before use.

This project performs this clearing in the `startup.s` file with the following code:

```asm
ldr r0, =__bss_start
ldr r1, =__bss_end
mov r2, #0
bss_clear:
    cmp r0, r1
    strlt r2, [r0], #4
    blt bss_clear
```

This snippet iterates over the entire `.bss` region and writes zeros, thus avoiding errors caused by garbage data or residual values.

Memory management in this bare-metal system is based on **clear and manual segmentation**, which favors full programmer control over the memory layout. This strategy is essential in embedded systems where there is no hardware abstraction like an MMU or host operating system.
