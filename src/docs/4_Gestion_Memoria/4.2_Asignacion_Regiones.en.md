### Region Assignment

Each component (OS and processes) has its own linker script (.ld), in which its memory layout is defined. A representative example is:

```ld
MEMORY {
    code : ORIGIN = 0x80010000, LENGTH = 128K
    stack : ORIGIN = 0x80018000, LENGTH = 32K
}

SECTIONS {
    . = ORIGIN(code);
    .text : { *(.text*) *(.rodata*) } > code
    .data : AT(ADDR(.text) + SIZEOF(.text)) { *(.data*) } > code
    .bss  : { *(.bss*) *(COMMON) } > code

    _stack_bottom = ORIGIN(stack);
    _stack_top = ORIGIN(stack) + LENGTH(stack);
}
```

* `.text` contains executable code and constants.
* `.data` contains initialized variables.
* `.bss` contains uninitialized variables.
* `stack` is separated and has its own safe region.

Each stack is manually initialized during system boot or by the scheduler, without relying on the typical C runtime system.
