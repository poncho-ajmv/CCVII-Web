## Entry Points

### Purpose of Entry Points

The entry points of user processes are functions that define the start of execution for each process. In this system, the design requires that the operating system can launch these processes independently, managing their entire context without the intervention of a traditional operating system.

Entry points serve key functions:

* They act as jump targets for context restoration.
* They allow starting the logic of each process from a fixed address.
* They ensure each process behaves predictably from the moment it is selected by the scheduler.

### Implementation

The entry points are the functions main_p1 and main_p2, declared in startup_process.s as global symbols:

```asm
.globl main_p1
.globl main_p2
```

And functionally defined in the files p1.c and p2.c:

```c
void main_p1(void) {
    while (1) { ... }
}

void main_p2(void) {
    while (1) { ... }
}
```

Each implements an infinite loop representing the lifecycle of the process.

### Association with the Process

When creating a process in os.c:

```c
int pid1 = create_process(main_p1);
int pid2 = create_process(main_p2);
```

The pointer to the function (main_p1, main_p2) is stored in the process_function field of the corresponding PCB structure. This tells the operating system the entry point when performing the initial jump during context switching:

```c
pcb->process_function = function;
```

### Stack Initialization with the Entry Point

When the scheduler detects a process whose stack is not initialized yet (i.e., its stack_pointer points to the start of its stack), it executes:

```c
current_process->stack_pointer = initialize_stack(current_process->process_function, current_process->stack_pointer);
```

This sets up a stack with a simulated context, including registers and the LR value pointing to the entry point (process function + 4), allowing the instruction bx lr to correctly jump to the process start.

### Process Startup

The actual startup occurs when start_first_process() is called. Internally, this function:

* Selects the first process with select_next_process().
* Switches SP to its stack.
* Pops {r0-r12, lr} to restore its contex
* Jumps to bx lr, starting the function pointed by process_function.

```asm
start_first_process:
    bl select_next_process
    mov sp, r0
    pop {r0-r12, lr}
    bx lr
```

### Independence and Modularity

Each entry point is completely decoupled from the operating system. This allows:

* Replacing processes without modifying the base system.
* Adding new processes with different entry functions.
* Testing processes individually without dependencies.

### Considerations for New Processes

When adding new processes, it is enough to:

1. Define a new global function (main_pX).
2. Ensure its name is globally available.
3. Pass the reference to create_process() during initialization in os_main().

Thus, the modular design based on entry points allows flexibility, clarity, and robustness when managing multiple processes in a bare-metal system.
