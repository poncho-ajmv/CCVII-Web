## Execution Logic

### General Purpose

The execution logic of user processes is designed to demonstrate the functioning of multiprogramming through a Round-Robin scheduler triggered by timer interrupts.

### General Structure of a Process

Each user process implements:

1. An infinite loop that ensures its persistence in the system.
2. A set of simple operations (printing characters via UART).
3. A wait delay to avoid saturating the serial output and to allow timed interrupts to have a visible effect.
4. Printing the current value of the program counter, which serves as validation of the state and progress of execution.

### Detailed Description of the Processes

#### Process 1: Digit Printing

* The process cycles through numbers from 0 to 9.
* Each digit is sent to UART, followed by a newline.
* An active wait (empty loop) is inserted after each digit.
* At the end of the cycle, the PC is printed to verify the process continues executing correctly.

```c
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    uart_send('0' + i);
    uart_send('\n');
    for (int j = 0; j < 10000000; j++); // delay
}
uart_hex(get_pc());
uart_send('\n');

#### Process 2: Letter Printing

* Similar to process 1, but prints letters from 'a' to 'z'.
* Achieved by using ASCII codes with an appropriate offset over the value '0'.
* Also prints the PC at the end of the cycle.

```c
for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    uart_send('0' + i + 17); // 'a' comienza en ASCII 97
    uart_send('\n');
    for (int j = 0; j < 10000000; j++);
}
uart_hex(get_pc());
uart_send('\n');
```

### Synchronization 

* **DMTimer2** generates periodic interrupts (every 3 seconds, configurable).

* These interrupts invoke the timer_irq_handler, which saves the current process context and selects the next one to execute.

This implements a form of **forced cooperative scheduling**, where processes "yield" their turn passively when a timer tick occurs.

### Robustness and Isolation

Each process:

* Uses its own stack, defined in the linker script and assigned during PCB initialization.
* Is isolated from the rest of the system in terms of code and data.
* Does not share data with other processes, avoiding race conditions.

The use of get_pc() printed via UART allows verifying that the process is active and located in the expected code region. Any deviation could indicate stack corruption or a failure in context switching.
