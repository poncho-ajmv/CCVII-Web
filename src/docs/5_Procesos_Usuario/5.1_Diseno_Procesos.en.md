## Process Design

### Design Objective

The multiprogrammed system is designed to run multiple user processes concurrently in a bare-metal environment. Since there is no traditional operating system or MMU available, each process must be carefully defined and isolated regarding its code, data, and stack.

### Number of Processes

The system is designed to handle up to **three processes** in its process table, of which:

* One is the operating system.
* Two are independent user processes.

Each user process is designed to run indefinitely, outputting an identifiable pattern via serial output.

### Separation and Isolation

To maintain system integrity:

* Each process has its **own segment of code, data, stack**, and entry function (`main_p1` and `main_p2`).
* Fixed memory allocation prevents collisions and allows safe context switches.
* The PCB contains the complete execution context of the process, including `stack_pointer`, `pid`, state, and a reference to its main function.

### Communication and Output

There is no communication between processes. Each process only uses UART to print results. This simplifies the initial design and serves as a demonstration of effective context switching.
