## Build Script

### Objective of the Build Process

On a bare-metal system like this, the build process is responsible for transforming source files written in C and assembler into a binary image that can be loaded directly into the BeagleBone Black's memory. This workflow must be completely customized due to the absence of a pre-existing operating system or runtime.

### Tools Used

The system is compiled using **GCC for ARM** tools (arm-none-eabi), which allow generating binaries for ARM platforms without a runtime environment.

* arm-none-eabi-gcc: Compiles C files without linking.
* arm-none-eabi-as: Assembles .s files.
* arm-none-eabi-ld: Links objects using a linker script.
* arm-none-eabi-objcopy: Converts the final ELF to a pure binary.
* arm-none-eabi-ar: Creates static libraries (.a).

### Flow Defined in the Makefile

The Makefile centralizes the entire process. Its main steps are:

1. **Compile each C or assembler file**:

    ```make
    %.o: %.c
    arm-none-eabi-gcc -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@
    ```

This ensures that each module is compiled independently with appropriate flags: no libc, no autostart, and no system dependencies.

2. **Building the OS Static Library**:

    ```make
    libos.a: $(OBJS)
    arm-none-eabi-ar rcs $@ $^
    ```
3. **Linking all user objects and processes**:

    ```make
    $(TARGET).elf: $(OBJS) $(P1_OBJ) $(P2_OBJ)
    arm-none-eabi-ld $(LDFLAGS) $^ -o $@
    ```

4. **Generating the final binary**:

    ```make
    $(TARGET).bin: $(TARGET).elf
    arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary $< $@
    ```

5. **Cleaning up temporary files**:

    ```make
    clean:
    rm -f *.o *.elf *.bin libos.a
    ```
### Process Features

* It is deterministic and reproducible.
* It separates system and process code.
* The result is an os.bin binary image ready to be loaded directly into memory.

### Applied Paradigm

This script reflects the principle of **total control of the build process**. It is not delegated to automated tools or abstract environments. This allows:

* Adjusting each stage according to specific requirements.
* Guaranteeing operating system independence.
* Integrating new processes or drivers without modifying the system core.

The build system is as essential as the operating system itself: it defines how the system will be created in memory.
