## Linker Configuration

### Linker Role in Bare-Metal Systems

The linker in this system performs a vital function: **placing each section of code and data in specific memory locations**, respecting the static organization necessary for correct execution without a memory management unit (MMU).

Each component (the operating system and user processes) has its own custom linker script:

* memmap_os.ld for the operating system.
* p1.ld, p2.ld for processes.

### Memory Segments

The scripts define fixed regions for code and the stack:

```ld
MEMORY {
code: ORIGIN = 0x80000000, LENGTH = 128K
stack: ORIGIN = 0x80008000, LENGTH = 32K
}
```

This ensures:

* Process isolation.
* Complete control over RAM usage.
* Collision prevention between code, data, and stacks.

### SECTIONS Structure

Each script declares the following sections:

```ld
.text : { *(.text*) *(.rodata*) } > code
.data : AT(ADDR(.text) + SIZEOF(.text)) { *(.data*) } > code
.bss : { *(.bss*) *(COMMON) } > code
```

* .text contains executable code and constants.
* .data stores initialized variables.
* .bss stores uninitialized variables and is manually cleaned up at startup.

Additionally, the following are defined:

```ld
_stack_bottom = ORIGIN(stack);
_stack_top = ORIGIN(stack) + LENGTH(stack);
```

These symbols are used by startup.s to properly initialize the SP (stack pointer).

### Multiple Scripts for Logical Separation

Each process is built and linked separately. The operating system includes them as objects (p1.o, p2.o) when linking os.elf, thanks to the uniformity of the linker scripts.

This allows:

* Loading processes into fixed, known regions.
* Initializing independent stacks.
* Testing processes in isolation if necessary.

### Applied Paradigm

The use of manual linker scripts reflects the principle of **deterministic memory mapping**. Each system component has its assigned region, and any memory access is predefined. This facilitates:

* Debugging by fixed address.
* Error traceability by memory section.
* Controlled integration of new modules or processes.

The linker is not just an assembly tool: it is an extension of the system architecture design.
