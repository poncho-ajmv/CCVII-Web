## Input/Output (I/O) Functions

### General Purpose

All I/O functions must be implemented from scratch and communicate directly with the hardware. In this case, the system uses **UART0** of the AM335x SoC for standard output, as the primary means of printing traces, debugging, and displaying process behavior.

### UART as an output channel

The UART is configured at a low level and is accessed through mapped memory addresses:

```c
#define UART0_BASE     0x44E09000
#define UART_THR       (UART0_BASE + 0x00) // Transmit Holding Register
#define UART_LSR       (UART0_BASE + 0x14) // Line Status Register
#define UART_LSR_THRE  0x20                // Transmit holding register empty
```

### Implemented Functions

The functions are centralized in uart.c:

* uart_send(unsigned char x): Sends a byte over the UART. Waits for the buffer to be ready.
* uart_decimal(unsigned int value): Converts and sends an unsigned integer value in base 10.
* uart_hex(unsigned int value): Sends a value in hexadecimal format (8 digits).
* PRINT(const char* s): Prints a null-terminated string.

These functions constitute the **lowest I/O abstraction layer** and are used by both the kernel and user processes.

### Example Usage

Within the operating system:

```c
PRINT("Starting OS...\n");
uart_decimal(pid);
uart_hex(value);
```

Within a user process:

```c
uart_send('A');
uart_send('\n');
```

### Applied Paradigm

These functions illustrate a fundamental principle of bare-metal design: **all hardware access is explicit, controlled, and transparent**. The absence of abstraction layers ensures maximum efficiency and control, which is essential in critical or real-time embedded systems.

### Considerations

* I/O functions are synchronized: the system waits for the buffer to be free.
* This may introduce delays, but allows for implementation simplicity and predictability.
* In more advanced systems, circular buffers and interrupt-based drivers could be implemented.
