## Entry Points

### Entry Point Definition

In this system, each user process has a clearly defined entry function:

* main_p1 for processing numbers.
* main_p2 for processing letters.

These functions are defined as global symbols in the startup_process.s file and referenced from p1.h and p2.h.

```asm
.globl main_p1
.globl main_p2
```

The operating system uses them as references when creating processes, passing these functions as pointers to the scheduler (scheduler.c).

### Registering in the PCB

Each process, when created using create_process(...), registers its main function as part of its PCB:

```c
pcb->process_function = function;
```

During the first context switch, if the process's stack_pointer points to the beginning of its stack, its stack is initialized with a simulated context. The value of the LR (link register) in that context points to the process's entry function:

```c
sp[13] = (unsigned int)func + 4; // lr points to the start of the process
```

### Execution from the Scheduler

When start_first_process() is called, the scheduler selects the first process, restores its context from the initialized stack, and makes a jump (bx lr) to the main_p1 or main_p2 function, as appropriate. This marks the effective start of execution for that process.

### Independence of Each Process

Each entry point is completely independent. There are no operating system calls or dependencies between processes. This promotes:

* Simplicity in execution.
* Clarity for debugging.
* Scalability for new processes with different main functions.
